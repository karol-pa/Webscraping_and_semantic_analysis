Now, FH4, 40hours is too much and about the other I don't wanna see in my life, I don't care. It's a huge disappointment compared to prevoius Forza's. It's empty, shallow, no real progression and the soundtrack is far beyond horrendous. And I'm not even saying about the SJW marxist ideology in it, with pronouns. FH3 has a great soundtrack, achievments, a real progression, which means you're not millionaire in the first hours/days in the game, and the map cities and places match with each other, they feel connected!\", 'genuinely a step up from fh2, ost is just amazing, i would recommend if you are just trying to have fun with racing games,', 'best forza game ever , No words. eeeeeeeeeeeeee', 'Glorified dlc once again from xbox. Why do they keep doing this over and over again.', \"It is a very beautiful, fascinating, and amazing game. It even lasts till this day as my main game (tho I also have Fh4). Tho there are some things like too much loading time etc. But it was far better than its time and it's still decent nowadays. It gets kinda boring tho. If you are kind of a budget guy, get this game. It's kinda dead but still works out. I'ma give it a solid 8\", 'De longe esse é o jogo que mais tenho horas jogadas com cockpit montado em casa.', \"I really liked it! Great game, great setting! I loved driving off-road and just driving in general, man. The game felt kinda short? I haven't completed everything, and likely never will. But it just felt like it was over way too soon. Especially those special races, they were my favorite part and I wish there were more.\", 'Had hours of fun in this game playing with friends and just alone over the summer.

The Map:This Beautiful map is set in Australia, There are land marks in the game like, Sufers Paradise, Byron bay, and more! The Cars:There are over 600 cars in the game. For example there are; Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Bugattis, and,,,, WAY MORE! The DLCs: There are 2 DLCs in the game, The 1st one is a Hot wheels expansion with a hotwheels map and over 5 Drivable HotWheels Cars in the game. The 2nd one is a snowy expansion, the map in the expansion is A Snowy Mountain and you get over 5 Offroady cars for the snowy mountain so you don't slip off\", \"Such a really good game, I played it for hours, I can't wait to play Forza 2 and 1\", 'Forza Horizon 3 delivered a gameplay with more freedom than FH1 and FH2 in many aspects, such as blueprint, forzavista and open wild map.', '[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]', '[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]', \"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10)Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. My favorite Arcade racing game. Use to spend whole days on this game racing with my friends. Australia is beautiful and the road layout of the map was perfect. Wish i could go back in time and relive this game in its prime. Horizon 3 was the first time Forza introduced drivatars which was a cool innovation. It was kinda cool racing with A! that had your friends username. I liked how you bulld up the festival stuff as a story thing. Set pieces for the showcase races was neat. A lot of cool improvements to there past games. I believe this was also the first time the series let you download/use peoples car designs too but a may be wrong about this one.\", 'Jogo muito bom. Houve uma melhora significativa.

All Horizon games are the same, but this is one of the better ones in my opinion', 'You can literally drive in a straight line in so many places on the map, plow through everything in your path, and never effect your speed with only minor damage to the car. This game is straight up arcade racing and it does it well but adds nothing to the genre thats defining Its pretty sure, but this dated formula with HD graphics is no where near enough to get anything higher then a 6 at best. Best console racer? No. Great arcade racing for noobs who want to play a racing game that limits itself to cater to that audience, Perfect fit', 'Forza Horizon 3 is THE game I go to for a shot of nostalgia! I’ve spent 12 days in total playing this and I’m still not tired of it. I’ll never stop playing this game because of how timeless it is. Oh the soundtrack, my favourite radio station was Block Party and for good reason! Sure Shot, Rings, Part Of, X Gon’ Give It To Ya, Higher, That’s Love, Shine, It’s Tricky! You know what? Im going to go play it now! See ya in my next review.', 'Forza Horizon 3 is best introduction to world of \"automobile enthusiast\" people, is first step toward sim-racing.

Qjqjjwjjwu2hh2bh3h3jj3jwjqkoq91988iqjjqnbwnwnwjikkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk', \"The good: You are the boss and director of Horizon Australia so the festival moves and grows according to your whims and particular ways of playing. You can customize your pilot, choosing from established models. There are more music stations like Hospital Records, Timeless FM (classical music), Groove Music (a streaming music service and your music library), in addition to the return of Horizon Pulse, Horizon Rocks. The multipliers for “Skill songs played by DJs from time to time are standardized. More than 700 different cars all with 360 degree view and cabin view (no premium cars) and integration to Forzavista. Street races away from the festival return. The game gives you the ability to “hire” four Drivatars to be your lineup of champions and earn joint credits by running at festivals for both yours and theirs. It has the Blizzard Mountain expansion pack with its own events in the snow and Thrill-topical (the Island of Hot Wheeles with life-size Hot Wheeles cars and many orange plastic track roads, speed launchers, jumps on fire rings and even An animatronic T-Rex, both expansions add many more hours of games, and the promotion of taking photos of cars is added to earn rewards. The bad: It doesn't have a strict order, so you might get lost playing in the danger zones, skidding, exploring the map, even street races outside the Horizon Festival, forgetting or leaving in the background the races and the festival itself and to advance in history. The Meh!: So much freedom makes it unpredictable and keeps you on the edge of the game as you go along. This time, the location of the bonus signs was well above the average for the other Forza Horizon games (they are strategically located, very difficult to locate). Many talk that Playground is a great developer and it is just that it is supported by Turn 10 and everything it has created for the Motorsport series.\", 'Это не игра, а полное \"г\" как можно играть в этот калл когда есть гранд туризмо короче, моя оценка этой недоигре 0', \"Forza Horizon 3 is unique in its own way. The ranks of fervent arcade racing are thinning, it is also full of fun. This is a world where summer doesn't end. This is a game about the holiday of life-a festival of music and racing.

The only thing that is s***y is the music... every radio **** ass... they should have added a nu-metal, death metal, oldschool rap and rave radios instead of awful pop/rock/newschool rap music, which you can hear here.

Además de su carencia absoluta de bugs (por lo menos en mi partida de más de 50 horas), el juego apenas tiene ralentizaciones, muy contadas y para nada estropearon la experiencia de juego, cuando hay ralentizaciones, sentís que son obvias, por ejemplo cuando manejas a 300 km/h mientras llueve en la ciudad.

With the Forza franchise now on its 10th outing (Forza Motorsport 7), it’s easy to see why Forza Horizon 3 was on many players’ top lists for 2016, as it doesn’t struggle at all keeping the series alive. I can honestly say without a shred of doubt that this is one of the best looking games this console generation, and I played it on a standard Xbox One without the 4K enhancements. I found myself stumbling to turn on the windshield wipers or grab for sunglasses regularly due to the impressive visuals from the background and weather effects, often forgetting I was playing a video game. From the detailed car interiors, the reflections bouncing off of the body of the cars, and the highly detailed beading effects from the water, this is the standard future games will seek to achieve and likely never accomplish. This is nothing short of car porn, sure to evoke a strange feeling in any car aficionado’s pants. If you’re new to the Forza Horizon series, it’s much like the standard Forza Motorsports titles, but feels a bit more arcade centric. While you can still tune your rides visually or mechanically as much or as little as you see fit, you don’t need to know the ins and outs of cars to make this enjoyable. The previous entries have made the player a willing participant in the Horizon festival, but this outing has you running the show. That said, there’s a huge wealth of customization options for how and when you race. Almost every event can be completed with any car, against any types of cars, with as many laps as you want. You can even save preferred settings for future races or share them with friends. The only exception to this is the Bucket List challenges, which task you with completing various objectives using specific vehicles, such as hitting speed checkpoints, racking up points in drifting challenges or simply racing point A to point B. Adding the option to create championships, as well as hitting all of the speed checkpoints, jumps, and XP boosting signs hidden throughout the vast Australian setting, there really is a lot to do here. Did I mention you can complete almost anything in co-op? Because you can, in addition to all of the online options available to you. There are a number of difficulty options and modifiers that can be toggled between races to ensure that you are always being challenged, with regular reminders or offers to change the settings in the event the game gets too easy or difficult for you. These make the title super accessible, especially for those of us who like to keep our foot on the accelerator nonstop. Despite each car controlling differently, the settings will help keep a mild standard between them, as some vehicles are more apt to spin out than others. The game does not belittle or penalize the player for using these outside of reducing the amount of credits and XP received for each action completed. These are needed to unlock additional perks, which provide various benefits to the player, as well as for purchasing new cars or fast traveling around the island. The island is massive, with a number of regions that give the player a wide variety of locales to race through, including beaches, jungles, and cityscapes. Progressing through the festival will unlock the option to select new areas to race through, which can be completed in any order the player chooses. Freedom like this is unheard of in most games, especially of the racing variety. Normally you would be forced to battle it out in some of the less exciting cars to get your feet wet, but here you can jump into a number of high end super cars right off of the rip. My one and only complaint is the inability to skip the voice over laden tutorials that never seem to stop. Yes, they do provide added insight into what you need to focus on in the game, but they are unnecessary and being unable to skip them is inexcusable. The same information could be conveyed in a short on screen display. While the loading times are not overly long, I found these to be tiresome and they limited the amount of time I could play in one sitting. If you’re in the need for speed or simply want to run around in the mud exploring the landscape, Forza Horizon 3 won’t disappoint. With its amazing visuals and wealth of content, the title will keep you busy for hours upon hours.', \"Firstly I would just like to state that Forza Horizon 3 is in my top two racing games of all time. I dont get into racing games I play mostly first person shoots, third person shooters, character action games, and RPG's. Over my 28 years I have been convinced by many ad's for racing games and almost none of them held my attention for more than say 8 hours of play time. Could not get into Forza motorsport 6, Project Cars, Project Gotham Racing, Need for Speed most wanted (the newer one), ect ect. I did enjoy The class burnout games, NFS Underground series, Midnight Club, again ect ect. I cant decied if this is IMO the best racing game I have ever played or if its burnout paradise. So why did I then give it 4 you ask? Performance. 30 frames per second is never fun. Never feels smooth makes the controls feel sluggish. If your think of buying this game buy it for the PC platform. I would easily give the PC version a 9 out of 10. The PC version is a butter smooth 60FPS with far better graphics than the console version. Its worth every penny and every second of your time. But only if you are thinking of getting the best version possible thats on PC.\", 'If this was my 1st horizon i would have put 10, but being the 3rd I\\'m disapointed by the lack of ambition: the map, is great but it becomes so boring after racing hours (it\\'s more or less 4 environments in a pochet size map)... No updates on sound except to make turbo so loud they hide the engine noise!! (ricer mode ON, certainly not car lover!). The career is pointless. The Sandbox do what you want is just a pale excuse to cut the costs on not even a simple reason to keep playing besides racing or exploring (the last one becoming quickly uninteresting due to the map size) The \"be the Horizon Boss\" is a joke as you do almost exactly the same as before, the difference being that it\\'s not the boss that suggest what you can do but your subordinate... what a great boss we are!! And the economic system getting more and more in the way... no more direct reward, you don\\'t make enough money by racing itself but by getting point that give you access to loot (sorry wheelspin), just to acclimate us more and more to the trash loot system like FM7 is showing us today and that FH4 and FM8 will keep on pushing to a next level later...', \"Best forza ever more new to the history, radio statios are realy funny and we have the option to play in simulation. This games deserves a 95 Can't wait for horzion 4\", 'Forza Horizon 3 is one of the best open world racing game of all time. Beautiful graphic, decent number of cars, great game play, massive events, dynamic weather all in one package. Horizon series is flexing its muscles, and becoming stronger and stronger. I would recommend this to every serious and casual gamers.', 'Forza Horizon 3 Roaring through the Australian outback in a thousand-horsepower Lamborghini at neck-braking speeds simply shows what type of game Horizon 3 is. It’s not a normal racing game – such as Forza’s Motorsport series, or Gran Turismo – it’s one that gives you an open road, and no limits. This is what Forza Horizon is. Maybe using a brand-new hypercar isn’t your thing – maybe you prefer a classic American muscle, or even Japanese tuners. Whatever your favourite car choice may be, Horizon has most likely got you covered. With over 350 cars from all corners of the world, there is an endless variety of cars to experience within the game. The amount of tuning and customization within the game means that you can turn something as slow as a Volvo 850 R into an extremely powerful beast capable of beating the fastest cars in the world. In recent years, the Need for Speed series has been improving the customisation side of their game to a high level, and for visual upgrades Need for Speed has a bigger variety, however for the performance upgrades Forza has far more possibilities and options. The standard for map design in the Forza Horizon series was already high, with Forza Horizon 2 being set in a beautiful location in Southern Europe alongside the Mediterranean. However, Horizon 3’s world completely eclipses it. Forza Horizon 3 is set in Australia, and the amount of different environments – such as Byron Bay, the Outback and the rainforests – is amazing. Furthermore, the attention to detail across the whole map is extraordinary, as even little things such as road markings, signs and even garbage bins outside houses are made with extreme care and precision. Whilst the map in Forza Horizon 3 is nothing in size in comparison to The Crew, the amount of changing landscapes and different environments makes it just as good, if not better. Helping the world look incredible is the new authentic lighting featured in Forza Horizon 3. The dramatic, ever-changing weather is simply some of the most realistic weather in any game. The reason the lighting is so impressive is because Playground Games, the developers, sent six staff members to New South Wales in Australia, armed with a 12K camera to simply record the sky. The variety of weather is realistic to what happens in Australia, adding to the authenticity of the game. In the last two Horizon games, your character was simply just an entrant in the Horizon festival, with strict guidelines on the events you had to do in a certain order. However, this time, your character is in charge of the festival. Any single event has no restrictions – you can choose the class of car, the type of car, the weather, the time, the amount of laps and more. Not only that, but as host of the festival you have a larger choice of activities to complete in the game. The incredible graphics come at a price, however: the game only runs at 30 frames per second on the Xbox One, remaining locked as always. Inconsistently, the game can drop to lower frames per second, but this is usually only during unimportant cut scenes in the game. However, because this new Forza is released on PC, it is possible to play at a higher frame rate, but you will need a powerful system. The recommended specs for playing at 60 frames per seconds is a NVIDIA GTX 1060 combined with an i7 3820 is what is needed. Sometimes the PC version can experience frame drops, and rarely the game can crash, however it does not happen often. There are also two expansion packs in the game – Blizzard Mountain, which takes players to snowy, torrential conditions and the ‘Hotwheels’ expansion. This expansion adds ‘Hotwheels’ ramps, stunts and cars that many people played with as children to the game, adding a high-octane dream containing life-size toys completing loops and half-pipes type of fun to the game. Taking a Pagani Zonda R on miles of stunts, banking on many iconic orange tracks from Hotwheels is delightful. It differs completely from Forza’s realism, adding a completely different automotive experience to the game. The fact that you do not get penalised for bad driving shows that Forza is striking a clear balance between an in-depth simulation and a fun casual game, and they are doing that very well. Sure, you can get rewarded for ‘clean driving’ if you do not hit anything for a while, but if you decide to completely smash through every fence in your way? ‘Great wreckage.’ Letting players get experience to rank up by driving how they want to show they believe there is no ‘real’ way to play the game, so you can play it exactly how you want to. Forza Horizon 3 is, in my opinion, the best ever racing game to be released. It has a great mix between realism and arcade, with a simply fantastic car selection, and so far it has not been boring once. This game is simply miles ahead of the current competition.', 'Uno de los mejores juegos Arcade de conducción de la historia.

Forza Horizon 3 stands out, firing as the best racing game of this generation.', 'Forza Horizon 3 is the first in this series of Horizon games that I have loved. Excellent car variety, very large open world, nice course variety, and very pretty visuals. Music has a wide variety, but nothing that really broke new ground. Car clubs have limited use and were not very well fleshed out. Online is fun with some interesting game modes. Ultimatly, this game is about the cars and the environment and it is excellent in both of those respects. Not a perfect game, but a great one that I have sunk many many hours into. Great pick up for a fun experience, but do not expect simulator level driving.', 'Forza Horizon vuelve mejor aun que el 2, algo que parecia dificil, pero ahi esta, horas y hora de juego para explorar, correr y competir, mil modos de juego, variedad brutal de coches, eventos todos los fines de semana que te hacen jugar para conseguir nuevos coches, un juego que gusta hasta a los que no son de juegos de coches.', 'Jogo é pika só que é enjoante.........................................................................................................................', \"Great graphics, detail and sound.

Long boring roads, generic sounding cars, annoying campaign races, and to top it all off, no canyons. Really? Hard to find a road that you can even consider a hard turn. What a pathetic failure. Don\\'t waste your money on this garbage, and don\\'t even get me started on how the car pass and DLCs work. Also, how could I forget about those lovely drivatars? The AI is amazing! I guarantee it\\'ll blow your mind! Haha yah right. It\\'s most certainly the worst AI ever to exist in any game. Don\\'t understand why they must base them off \"the driving of actual players\". Either way, there\\'s about a thousand constantly crashing into you in single player. Yeah you could go to a private online session to get rid of them, but at the same time negate the very purpose of single player. What a joke.', 'To be honest, i never played forza horizon one all to much, but i played the heck out of forza horizon 2, and once i got my hand on forza horizon 3, i knew i would love it, and i did, i love all types of games', 'A good game, with just about enough to warrant purchase, from a franchise thats starting to feel old, and in need of some new gimmicks. Theres a lot to do, but unfortunately not a lot of variety, the game has a knack for telling you in a loud Australian accent how excited you should be to re-race that same circuit. Beautiful design throughout, and the cars handle great. But it uses a lot of the same jokes Horizon 2 (and 1) used and the addition of microtransactions is an unwanted.', 'Ah, Forza Horizon 3. The only place I wil see a Centenario. Forza Horizon 3 checkmarks a new generation (really) for racing games. It reminds of a brilliant open world game mixed with a few racing cars. Except that it is more. The things that make the game amazing are super clear. The graphics, the driving, and of course, the freedom. Forza makes you feel like a hero in a car. I found myself rather driving to a place instead of fast travel. It grabs you along for the journey, and you will not want to end it.', 'To be honest, I have never seen a more perfect game. Truly beautyful visuals, an amazing sound design, incredible. Also the world is one of the best in gaming, with vast areas and lots of great roads and dirt tracks. Sure there isn`t much of a story or to do except drive around, and it could have needed a few more showcases as post game, but the feeling of riding your dream car through the breathtaking Australian country side is something I will never forget. The car selection is also great, however its a hard grind to get enough cash for the most expensive cars, but as long as we have wheelspins thats no problem. All in all Im in love, everything else is simply perfect. Best Game EVER', 'Simply amazing! Every single thing about Forza Horizon 3 is amazing. I\\'ve always been a Forza Motorsport fan, but I absolutely love the festival theme of the Horizon series. The scenery, the stunning sunsets, the music and the beautiful (and wide variety of) cars. In Forza Horizon 3 you get a little bit of everything. The festival is set in Australia this time. It\\'s a very diverse map: bushy jungles, beautiful beaches, a big desert and a vibrant city. They\\'ve also added a snowy mountain map with the Blizzard Mountain DLC, which is a great addition to FH3. I\\'ve played it for over 70 hours now, but I\\'m not even close to getting bored by it. Playground adds new content to the game every month, both payed and free content. With Forzathon you have a chance to win unique cars by completing challenges. It\\'s a lot of fun and makes me come back to FH3 every time. It\\'s also a great game to play with friends. Just cruising around (and showing off your car collection), online \"mini\" games like capture the flag or the online tournaments are all fantastic. Forza Horizon 3 definitely deserves a 10/10!', 'Encore plus chatoyant et plus grand, l\\'Horizon nouveau pousse le bouchon jusque chez les kangourous et s\\'impose d\\'emblée comme l\\'un des plus beaux jeux de bagnoles en monde ouvert. Il ne souffre d\\'aucun ralentissement et s\\'avère étonnamment spectaculaire avec sa météo évolutive, son cycle jour-nuit et... son monde immense ! Il manque tout de même -en fait- des piétons que l\\'on pourrait écraser à sa guise, un peu comme dans Carma euh... mais je digresse... On peut déjà rouler n\\'importe où n\\'importe comment comme un gros con avec son gros kat\\'kat ou sa Lambaudi à 200 000 euros et ça, c\\'est rigolol à ce qu\\'il paraît. Evidemment toujours aussi arcade -rien à voir avec un Motorsport- le jeu se prend facilement en main comme ses aînés et se révèle plutôt distrayant... un certain temps qui devient de plus en plus limité au fur et à mesure que l\\'ennui progresse à très grande vitesse... Le multi-joueurs n\\'est plus aussi agréable ni efficace que dans le premier Horizon et son audience m\\'a semblé en net recul, car elle comprend tout à la fois : les super-débilos, les transfuges des GTrons et le public NFS ! le pire des mondes en fait, rassemblé dans une foire lente et lourdingue de kévins et de temps de chargement. En outre, Horizon 3 se révèle une abominable usine remplie de remplissage qu\\'il vous faudra limer jusqu\\'à l\\'intox. Ce n\\'est évidemment pas le modèle physique qui va nous motiver plus que ça puisqu\\'il reste très ballot, ni le ton toujours autant ciblé \"jeunes adulescents\" qui va nous pousser à enchaîner comme un crevard toutes ces courses à la mords-moi-le-zob. Il faudra donc se restreindre sous peine de vomir de l\\'horizon qui rend con ou de devenir complètement con soi-même. Courage... fuyons.', 'Most beautiful racing game out there, majority of the time spent exploring and enjoying the vast open views of what Forza horizon has to offer. If you have a xbox one S and a 4k TV, this game will not disappoint.', 'In theory, Forza Horizon 3 ought to be the best racing game ever. It has the state-of-the-art upgrading, tuning and aesthetic cusotmisation mechanics which have evolved over a decade, combined with the most content ever in a Forza game in an open-world setting. With so many things to do, it\\'s baffling where to start. Here are just some of the things you\\'\\' encounter: speed zones, speed traps, drift zones, danger signs (\"jump zones\"), bucket list challenges, rivals events, street races & midnight battles, head-to-head races, ForzaThons (weekend challenges), convoys, barn finds, skills (perks), spotlights (more collectibles), showcase events, wheelspins, smash boards (collectibles), festival sites, as well as a ton of unique routes; each with the usual single-race, championship and Rivals variants; all across 488 roads and over 400 cars to discover. Now you can even make your own Bucket List challenges and have more options in choosing vehicle restrictions. And yet, despite all of this, the game feels... bland. Sure, the music is great and the auction house is back, and the graphics are better than ever, but none of this makes the experience enjoyable. You see, there comes a point where a game becomes too bloated for its own good. When you have an open-world map which is bulging with content like this, it\\'s almost laughable. It reminds me of Far Cry 4: the developers simply went with the \"more is better\" philosophy, and in doing so, they ruined the player experience. There\\'s definitely fun to be had here, and if you pick & choose carefully, you\\'ll be hard-pushed to find at least something you like, no matter how casual or hardcore of a racing game fan you are. In trying to appeal to the broadest possible audience, Playground Games have created a game where \"busywork\" is the defining feature. Annoyances such as ANNA - the personal assistant which CANNOT be disabled, the forced interactions with the whole cheesey \"Festival\"/party theme, the inability to just completely ignore things you don\\'t care about (like barn finds and adding drivers to your lineup), the overly long \"tutorial\". It\\'s all just too much. When you have 5 different \"currencies\" (credits, XP, skill points, wheelspins, fans) and a complete open-world where most of your time is spent offroad (yet most of the cars are obviously not designed for it), there\\'s only so much \"ceremony\" one can endure before it becomes a grind. As a huge fan of the racing genre and the Forza franchise, Horizon 3 will be my last Horizon game. The loading times are too long, there\\'s too much unnecessary fluff and lacking in refinement. In conclusion, I can recommend Forza Horizon 3 to almost anyone with enough time and patience for excessive bloat and a playground where there\\'s far more content than there ought to be. If you want \"more Horizon\" - both in variety and volume - Horizon 3 undoubtedly delivers. Just be careful what you wish for.', \"People expect this game to be realistic in every manner. It's not it's purpose. If you want realism, go play Forza 6. Forza Horizon 3 looks real but feels magical. Driving over the water and making spectacular high jumps without killing yourself or your car is all but real. It's all about fun, and this game is a hell lot of fun. Drop your expectations and just have fun.\", \"I've had a blast with this game! The environment is fun, the cars and sounds are top notch. The lighting effects help with the realistic feel. My main issue has been with online party play. I've tried to get into a party with multiple friends and we've never been able to all connect to the same party which is a shame. Customization is fun, I like the wide body option however I wish it was available on more models. It's fun to search out barn finds and the various festival sights are cool. I typically like more realistic races so I wish that this game incorporated circuit options as well to add more of a balance between real racing the open world racing.\", \"A excellent 'spiritual successor' to games like Test Drive Unlimited. Graphically it is absolutely gorgeous, I had the opportunity to play this on a 4K HDR screen recently and sometimes it looked actually real. The models are phenomenal and the scenery is beautiful. This is a visual orgy for your eyes. My only **** is that this could look better, the PS4 would deliver better graphics and frankly it is so close to perfection it is frustrating that it isn't on the best hardware. The game itself is standard racing/driving sim fare which is just what is required. The 'festival' theme is entertaining but I'm not a massive fan. This game would get a 10 but the DLC is overpriced and too much like content that should be in the base game. Still a classic of this generation, but unlikely to be an 'all time' classic.\", \"Best open world racing game ever! The only complaint I have is the voice actors are kind of annoying and the $129.99 version doesn't get you all the content and it totally should. Still an awesome driving game\", 'Now I’m not new to the Forza Horizon franchise so it probably prevents me from having an entirely unbiased view. Pros: Beautiful setting, containing different environments for you to drive around and take in the views. Lots of different types of races and events to do in single player mode. Being in-charge of the festivals is pretty cool and gives you something to work towards. Vast amount of cars to choose from. Car dynamics are good and the balance of IA cars hitting you (in-race) has improved since Forza 6. Forzathon weekly events Forzahorizon Edition cars (they have boosts) Cons: Map feels too cluttered as you’re constantly unlocking events to do and you can’t keep up. Cap for amount of players in one world is still too small. Very fiddly to change car and upgrade in comparison to older FH games. Too many drivatars change lane and wipe you out when driving in the open world. Lots of different events but they all taken place on a small amount of actual circuits. Wrist bands seem like a second thought. Now I’ve played the game for quite a few hours and I’ve got to say, I’m really enjoying it. There’s parts of the game that are better than FH2 and parts that aren’t. As usual, they have nailed the driving, which is really the bread and butter of the game. If you haven’t played FH2 then pick that up first as it’s a great game and a good introduction to the franchise, especially if you are mainly into single player.', 'El mejor juego arcade de coches de la historia, asi de simple.

NO, it\\'s not enough! --The map is huuuge but it has to be when you\\'re into racing looong distances.. Houses all look the same, and it reminded me of the fans in Madden & EA Sports games. Where there\\'s like 5-8 different fans and they fill the whole stadium.. Or like Dead Rising, and all ZOmbie games where you\\'ll have 5-8 different Zombies that you\\'ll see 1000 times.... **I found myself bored in **** fans/fame increased to fast, and too easy..I didn\\'t even do anything and I already unlocked the 2nd and 3rd area\\'s...This is BS! **The clearly is geared towards novice players.

I ended up mailing it back to Gamefly instead of buying it from Gamefly. ~Gamefly~ FYI~ Has a pretty awesome system for purchasing games. esp when you already have the game **** select \"keep\" and they then mail you the original case, and you always get the Day one edition with all the insert codes etc.. Members get automatic 10% off and free shipping and members get a $5 off coupon EVERY month..

Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10)Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. My favorite Arcade racing game. Use to spend whole days on this game racing with my friends. Australia is beautiful and the road layout of the map was perfect. Wish i could go back in time and relive this game in its prime. Horizon 3 was the first time Forza introduced drivatars which was a cool innovation. It was kinda cool racing with A! that had your friends username. I liked how you bulld up the festival stuff as a story thing. Set pieces for the showcase races was neat. A lot of cool improvements to there past games.

The bad: It doesn't have a strict order, so you might get lost playing in the danger zones, skidding, exploring the map, even street races outside the Horizon Festival, forgetting or leaving in the background the races and the festival itself and to advance in history. The Meh!: So much freedom makes it unpredictable and keeps you on the edge of the game as you go along. This time, the location of the bonus signs was well above the average for the other Forza Horizon games (they are strategically located, very difficult to locate).

I can honestly say without a shred of doubt that this is one of the best looking games this console generation, and I played it on a standard Xbox One without the 4K enhancements. I found myself stumbling to turn on the windshield wipers or grab for sunglasses regularly due to the impressive visuals from the background and weather effects, often forgetting I was playing a video game. From the detailed car interiors, the reflections bouncing off of the body of the cars, and the highly detailed beading effects from the water, this is the standard future games will seek to achieve and likely never accomplish. This is nothing short of car porn, sure to evoke a strange feeling in any car aficionado’s pants. If you’re new to the Forza Horizon series, it’s much like the standard Forza Motorsports titles, but feels a bit more arcade centric. While you can still tune your rides visually or mechanically as much or as little as you see fit, you don’t need to know the ins and outs of cars to make this enjoyable. The previous entries have made the player a willing participant in the Horizon festival, but this outing has you running the show. That said, there’s a huge wealth of customization options for how and when you race. Almost every event can be completed with any car, against any types of cars, with as many laps as you want. You can even save preferred settings for future races or share them with friends. The only exception to this is the Bucket List challenges, which task you with completing various objectives using specific vehicles, such as hitting speed checkpoints, racking up points in drifting challenges or simply racing point A to point B. Adding the option to create championships, as well as hitting all of the speed checkpoints, jumps, and XP boosting signs hidden throughout the vast Australian setting, there really is a lot to do here. Did I mention you can complete almost anything in co-op? Because you can, in addition to all of the online options available to you. There are a number of difficulty options and modifiers that can be toggled between races to ensure that you are always being challenged, with regular reminders or offers to change the settings in the event the game gets too easy or difficult for you. These make the title super accessible, especially for those of us who like to keep our foot on the accelerator nonstop. Despite each car controlling differently, the settings will help keep a mild standard between them, as some vehicles are more apt to spin out than others. The game does not belittle or penalize the player for using these outside of reducing the amount of credits and XP received for each action completed. These are needed to unlock additional perks, which provide various benefits to the player, as well as for purchasing new cars or fast traveling around the island. The island is massive, with a number of regions that give the player a wide variety of locales to race through, including beaches, jungles, and cityscapes. Progressing through the festival will unlock the option to select new areas to race through, which can be completed in any order the player chooses. Freedom like this is unheard of in most games, especially of the racing variety. Normally you would be forced to battle it out in some of the less exciting cars to get your feet wet, but here you can jump into a number of high end super cars right off of the rip. My one and only complaint is the inability to skip the voice over laden tutorials that never seem to stop. Yes, they do provide added insight into what you need to focus on in the game, but they are unnecessary and being unable to skip them is inexcusable. The same information could be conveyed in a short on screen display. While the loading times are not overly long, I found these to be tiresome and they limited the amount of time I could play in one sitting. If you’re in the need for speed or simply want to run around in the mud exploring the landscape, Forza Horizon 3 won’t disappoint. With its amazing visuals and wealth of content, the title will keep you busy for hours upon hours.', \"Firstly I would just like to state that Forza Horizon 3 is in my top two racing games of all time. I dont get into racing games I play mostly first person shoots, third person shooters, character action games, and RPG's. Over my 28 years I have been convinced by many ad's for racing games and almost none of them held my attention for more than say 8 hours of play time. Could not get into Forza motorsport 6, Project Cars, Project Gotham Racing, Need for Speed most wanted (the newer one), ect ect. I did enjoy The class burnout games, NFS Underground series, Midnight Club, again ect ect. I cant decied if this is IMO the best racing game I have ever played or if its burnout paradise. So why did I then give it 4 you ask? Performance. 30 frames per second is never fun. Never feels smooth makes the controls feel sluggish. If your think of buying this game buy it for the PC platform. I would easily give the PC version a 9 out of 10. The PC version is a butter smooth 60FPS with far better graphics than the console version. Its worth every penny and every second of your time. But only if you are thinking of getting the best version possible thats on PC.\", 'If this was my 1st horizon i would have put 10, but being the 3rd I\\'m disapointed by the lack of ambition: the map, is great but it becomes so boring after racing hours (it\\'s more or less 4 environments in a pochet size map)... No updates on sound except to make turbo so loud they hide the engine noise!! (ricer mode ON, certainly not car lover!). The career is pointless. The Sandbox do what you want is just a pale excuse to cut the costs on not even a simple reason to keep playing besides racing or exploring (the last one becoming quickly uninteresting due to the map size) The \"be the Horizon Boss\" is a joke as you do almost exactly the same as before, the difference being that it\\'s not the boss that suggest what you can do but your subordinate... what a great boss we are!! And the economic system getting more and more in the way... no more direct reward, you don\\'t make enough money by racing itself but by getting point that give you access to loot (sorry wheelspin), just to acclimate us more and more to the trash loot system like FM7 is showing us today and that FH4 and FM8 will keep on pushing to a next level later...', \"Best forza ever more new to the history, radio statios are realy funny and we have the option to play in simulation. This games deserves a 95 Can't wait for horzion 4\", 'Forza Horizon 3 is one of the best open world racing game of all time. Beautiful graphic, decent number of cars, great game play, massive events, dynamic weather all in one package. Horizon series is flexing its muscles, and becoming stronger and stronger. I would recommend this to every serious and casual gamers.', 'Forza Horizon 3 Roaring through the Australian outback in a thousand-horsepower Lamborghini at neck-braking speeds simply shows what type of game Horizon 3 is. It’s not a normal racing game – such as Forza’s Motorsport series, or Gran Turismo – it’s one that gives you an open road, and no limits. This is what Forza Horizon is. Maybe using a brand-new hypercar isn’t your thing – maybe you prefer a classic American muscle, or even Japanese tuners. Whatever your favourite car choice may be, Horizon has most likely got you covered. With over 350 cars from all corners of the world, there is an endless variety of cars to experience within the game. The amount of tuning and customization within the game means that you can turn something as slow as a Volvo 850 R into an extremely powerful beast capable of beating the fastest cars in the world. In recent years, the Need for Speed series has been improving the customisation side of their game to a high level, and for visual upgrades Need for Speed has a bigger variety, however for the performance upgrades Forza has far more possibilities and options. The standard for map design in the Forza Horizon series was already high, with Forza Horizon 2 being set in a beautiful location in Southern Europe alongside the Mediterranean. However, Horizon 3’s world completely eclipses it. Forza Horizon 3 is set in Australia, and the amount of different environments – such as Byron Bay, the Outback and the rainforests – is amazing. Furthermore, the attention to detail across the whole map is extraordinary, as even little things such as road markings, signs and even garbage bins outside houses are made with extreme care and precision. Whilst the map in Forza Horizon 3 is nothing in size in comparison to The Crew, the amount of changing landscapes and different environments makes it just as good, if not better. Helping the world look incredible is the new authentic lighting featured in Forza Horizon 3. The dramatic, ever-changing weather is simply some of the most realistic weather in any game. The reason the lighting is so impressive is because Playground Games, the developers, sent six staff members to New South Wales in Australia, armed with a 12K camera to simply record the sky. The variety of weather is realistic to what happens in Australia, adding to the authenticity of the game. In the last two Horizon games, your character was simply just an entrant in the Horizon festival, with strict guidelines on the events you had to do in a certain order. However, this time, your character is in charge of the festival. Any single event has no restrictions – you can choose the class of car, the type of car, the weather, the time, the amount of laps and more. Not only that, but as host of the festival you have a larger choice of activities to complete in the game. The incredible graphics come at a price, however: the game only runs at 30 frames per second on the Xbox One, remaining locked as always. Inconsistently, the game can drop to lower frames per second, but this is usually only during unimportant cut scenes in the game. However, because this new Forza is released on PC, it is possible to play at a higher frame rate, but you will need a powerful system. The recommended specs for playing at 60 frames per seconds is a NVIDIA GTX 1060 combined with an i7 3820 is what is needed. Sometimes the PC version can experience frame drops, and rarely the game can crash, however it does not happen often. There are also two expansion packs in the game – Blizzard Mountain, which takes players to snowy, torrential conditions and the ‘Hotwheels’ expansion. This expansion adds ‘Hotwheels’ ramps, stunts and cars that many people played with as children to the game, adding a high-octane dream containing life-size toys completing loops and half-pipes type of fun to the game. Taking a Pagani Zonda R on miles of stunts, banking on many iconic orange tracks from Hotwheels is delightful. It differs completely from Forza’s realism, adding a completely different automotive experience to the game. The fact that you do not get penalised for bad driving shows that Forza is striking a clear balance between an in-depth simulation and a fun casual game, and they are doing that very well. Sure, you can get rewarded for ‘clean driving’ if you do not hit anything for a while, but if you decide to completely smash through every fence in your way? ‘Great wreckage.’ Letting players get experience to rank up by driving how they want to show they believe there is no ‘real’ way to play the game, so you can play it exactly how you want to. Forza Horizon 3 is, in my opinion, the best ever racing game to be released. It has a great mix between realism and arcade, with a simply fantastic car selection, and so far it has not been boring once. This game is simply miles ahead of the current competition.', 'Uno de los mejores juegos Arcade de conducción de la historia. Jugabilidad, mundo abierto, gráficas, rejugable, mejorado en todos los apartados a las anteriores entregas, se los recomiendo a los amantes de los juegos de conducción.', \"I play this game for a very long time now and I am just lvl 386, but its a lot of fun to play I never get bored and Forza is right now making the best games ever realistic and fun u can make a lot of credits in a short time and make u'r own design for u car(s)\", 'Un gioco a cui non si può rinunciare , il miglior gioco di auto free roaming con grafica epica e tantissime auto tutte da truccare e potenziare .. Come la serie Forza ci ha abituato da anni , è il re delle auto', \"beautiful graphics, full of content, gameplay is entertaining. You can customize paints, upgrade and tune cars. Even after completing the game I still find myself playing it, because you can challenge friends by setting rival blueprints or jump in online races and so much more. If it wasn't for the pesky ai drivatars that tends to hold me up in and out of corners I would have easily given it a 10 out of 10 stars.\", 'In the face of the undisputed beauty, it is really fantastic to accelerate a Lamborghini on the beach, to run through the forests and to do rallies in the desert, is something that impacts and impresses, in this the freedom to run aimlessly enjoying the scenery, is to take off the hat. Forza Horizon 3 stands out, firing as the best racing game of this generation.', 'Forza Horizon 3 is the first in this series of Horizon games that I have loved. Excellent car variety, very large open world, nice course variety, and very pretty visuals. Music has a wide variety, but nothing that really broke new ground. Car clubs have limited use and were not very well fleshed out. Online is fun with some interesting game modes. Ultimatly, this game is about the cars and the environment and it is excellent in both of those respects. Not a perfect game, but a great one that I have sunk many many hours into. Great pick up for a fun experience, but do not expect simulator level driving.', 'Forza Horizon vuelve mejor aun que el 2, algo que parecia dificil, pero ahi esta, horas y hora de juego para explorar, correr y competir, mil modos de juego, variedad brutal de coches, eventos todos los fines de semana que te hacen jugar para conseguir nuevos coches, un juego que gusta hasta a los que no son de juegos de coches.', 'Jogo é pika só que é enjoante.........................................................................................................................', \"Great graphics, detail and sound. One of, if not the best, driving games available. This is a game that made me turn on my Xbox One for the first time in a year. Xbox needs more exclusives like this to compete with Sony's list.\", 'Trash. Absolute trash. Seriously disappointed on how bad it is. Long boring roads, generic sounding cars, annoying campaign races, and to top it all off, no canyons. Really? Hard to find a road that you can even consider a hard turn. What a pathetic failure. Don\\'t waste your money on this garbage, and don\\'t even get me started on how the car pass and DLCs work. Also, how could I forget about those lovely drivatars? The AI is amazing! I guarantee it\\'ll blow your mind! Haha yah right. It\\'s most certainly the worst AI ever to exist in any game. Don\\'t understand why they must base them off \"the driving of actual players\". Either way, there\\'s about a thousand constantly crashing into you in single player. Yeah you could go to a private online session to get rid of them, but at the same time negate the very purpose of single player. What a joke.', 'To be honest, i never played forza horizon one all to much, but i played the heck out of forza horizon 2, and once i got my hand on forza horizon 3, i knew i would love it, and i did, i love all types of games', 'A good game, with just about enough to warrant purchase, from a franchise thats starting to feel old, and in need of some new gimmicks. Theres a lot to do, but unfortunately not a lot of variety, the game has a knack for telling you in a loud Australian accent how excited you should be to re-race that same circuit. Beautiful design throughout, and the cars handle great. But it uses a lot of the same jokes Horizon 2 (and 1) used and the addition of microtransactions is an unwanted.', 'Ah, Forza Horizon 3. The only place I wil see a Centenario. Forza Horizon 3 checkmarks a new generation (really) for racing games. It reminds of a brilliant open world game mixed with a few racing cars. Except that it is more. The things that make the game amazing are super clear. The graphics, the driving, and of course, the freedom. Forza makes you feel like a hero in a car. I found myself rather driving to a place instead of fast travel. It grabs you along for the journey, and you will not want to end it.', 'To be honest, I have never seen a more perfect game. Truly beautyful visuals, an amazing sound design, incredible. Also the world is one of the best in gaming, with vast areas and lots of great roads and dirt tracks. Sure there isn`t much of a story or to do except drive around, and it could have needed a few more showcases as post game, but the feeling of riding your dream car through the breathtaking Australian country side is something I will never forget. The car selection is also great, however its a hard grind to get enough cash for the most expensive cars, but as long as we have wheelspins thats no problem. All in all Im in love, everything else is simply perfect. Best Game EVER', 'Simply amazing! Every single thing about Forza Horizon 3 is amazing. I\\'ve always been a Forza Motorsport fan, but I absolutely love the festival theme of the Horizon series. The scenery, the stunning sunsets, the music and the beautiful (and wide variety of) cars. In Forza Horizon 3 you get a little bit of everything. The festival is set in Australia this time. It\\'s a very diverse map: bushy jungles, beautiful beaches, a big desert and a vibrant city. They\\'ve also added a snowy mountain map with the Blizzard Mountain DLC, which is a great addition to FH3. I\\'ve played it for over 70 hours now, but I\\'m not even close to getting bored by it. Playground adds new content to the game every month, both payed and free content. With Forzathon you have a chance to win unique cars by completing challenges. It\\'s a lot of fun and makes me come back to FH3 every time. It\\'s also a great game to play with friends. Just cruising around (and showing off your car collection), online \"mini\" games like capture the flag or the online tournaments are all fantastic. Forza Horizon 3 definitely deserves a 10/10!', 'Encore plus chatoyant et plus grand, l\\'Horizon nouveau pousse le bouchon jusque chez les kangourous et s\\'impose d\\'emblée comme l\\'un des plus beaux jeux de bagnoles en monde ouvert. Il ne souffre d\\'aucun ralentissement et s\\'avère étonnamment spectaculaire avec sa météo évolutive, son cycle jour-nuit et... son monde immense ! Il manque tout de même -en fait- des piétons que l\\'on pourrait écraser à sa guise, un peu comme dans Carma euh... mais je digresse... On peut déjà rouler n\\'importe où n\\'importe comment comme un gros con avec son gros kat\\'kat ou sa Lambaudi à 200 000 euros et ça, c\\'est rigolol à ce qu\\'il paraît. Evidemment toujours aussi arcade -rien à voir avec un Motorsport- le jeu se prend facilement en main comme ses aînés et se révèle plutôt distrayant... un certain temps qui devient de plus en plus limité au fur et à mesure que l\\'ennui progresse à très grande vitesse... Le multi-joueurs n\\'est plus aussi agréable ni efficace que dans le premier Horizon et son audience m\\'a semblé en net recul, car elle comprend tout à la fois : les super-débilos, les transfuges des GTrons et le public NFS ! le pire des mondes en fait, rassemblé dans une foire lente et lourdingue de kévins et de temps de chargement. En outre, Horizon 3 se révèle une abominable usine remplie de remplissage qu\\'il vous faudra limer jusqu\\'à l\\'intox. Ce n\\'est évidemment pas le modèle physique qui va nous motiver plus que ça puisqu\\'il reste très ballot, ni le ton toujours autant ciblé \"jeunes adulescents\" qui va nous pousser à enchaîner comme un crevard toutes ces courses à la mords-moi-le-zob. Il faudra donc se restreindre sous peine de vomir de l\\'horizon qui rend con ou de devenir complètement con soi-même. Courage... fuyons.', 'Most beautiful racing game out there, majority of the time spent exploring and enjoying the vast open views of what Forza horizon has to offer. If you have a xbox one S and a 4k TV, this game will not disappoint.', 'In theory, Forza Horizon 3 ought to be the best racing game ever. It has the state-of-the-art upgrading, tuning and aesthetic cusotmisation mechanics which have evolved over a decade, combined with the most content ever in a Forza game in an open-world setting. With so many things to do, it\\'s baffling where to start. Here are just some of the things you\\'\\' encounter: speed zones, speed traps, drift zones, danger signs (\"jump zones\"), bucket list challenges, rivals events, street races & midnight battles, head-to-head races, ForzaThons (weekend challenges), convoys, barn finds, skills (perks), spotlights (more collectibles), showcase events, wheelspins, smash boards (collectibles), festival sites, as well as a ton of unique routes; each with the usual single-race, championship and Rivals variants; all across 488 roads and over 400 cars to discover. Now you can even make your own Bucket List challenges and have more options in choosing vehicle restrictions. And yet, despite all of this, the game feels... bland. Sure, the music is great and the auction house is back, and the graphics are better than ever, but none of this makes the experience enjoyable. You see, there comes a point where a game becomes too bloated for its own good. When you have an open-world map which is bulging with content like this, it\\'s almost laughable. It reminds me of Far Cry 4: the developers simply went with the \"more is better\" philosophy, and in doing so, they ruined the player experience. There\\'s definitely fun to be had here, and if you pick & choose carefully, you\\'ll be hard-pushed to find at least something you like, no matter how casual or hardcore of a racing game fan you are. In trying to appeal to the broadest possible audience, Playground Games have created a game where \"busywork\" is the defining feature. Annoyances such as ANNA - the personal assistant which CANNOT be disabled, the forced interactions with the whole cheesey \"Festival\"/party theme, the inability to just completely ignore things you don\\'t care about (like barn finds and adding drivers to your lineup), the overly long \"tutorial\". It\\'s all just too much. When you have 5 different \"currencies\" (credits, XP, skill points, wheelspins, fans) and a complete open-world where most of your time is spent offroad (yet most of the cars are obviously not designed for it), there\\'s only so much \"ceremony\" one can endure before it becomes a grind. As a huge fan of the racing genre and the Forza franchise, Horizon 3 will be my last Horizon game. The loading times are too long, there\\'s too much unnecessary fluff and lacking in refinement. In conclusion, I can recommend Forza Horizon 3 to almost anyone with enough time and patience for excessive bloat and a playground where there\\'s far more content than there ought to be. If you want \"more Horizon\" - both in variety and volume - Horizon 3 undoubtedly delivers. Just be careful what you wish for.', \"People expect this game to be realistic in every manner. It's not it's purpose. If you want realism, go play Forza 6. Forza Horizon 3 looks real but feels magical. Driving over the water and making spectacular high jumps without killing yourself or your car is all but real. It's all about fun, and this game is a hell lot of fun. Drop your expectations and just have fun.\", \"I've had a blast with this game! The environment is fun, the cars and sounds are top notch. The lighting effects help with the realistic feel. My main issue has been with online party play. I've tried to get into a party with multiple friends and we've never been able to all connect to the same party which is a shame. Customization is fun, I like the wide body option however I wish it was available on more models. It's fun to search out barn finds and the various festival sights are cool. I typically like more realistic races so I wish that this game incorporated circuit options as well to add more of a balance between real racing the open world racing.\", \"A excellent 'spiritual successor' to games like Test Drive Unlimited. Graphically it is absolutely gorgeous, I had the opportunity to play this on a 4K HDR screen recently and sometimes it looked actually real. The models are phenomenal and the scenery is beautiful. This is a visual orgy for your eyes. My only **** is that this could look better, the PS4 would deliver better graphics and frankly it is so close to perfection it is frustrating that it isn't on the best hardware. The game itself is standard racing/driving sim fare which is just what is required. The 'festival' theme is entertaining but I'm not a massive fan. This game would get a 10 but the DLC is overpriced and too much like content that should be in the base game. Still a classic of this generation, but unlikely to be an 'all time' classic.\", \"Best open world racing game ever! The only complaint I have is the voice actors are kind of annoying and the $129.99 version doesn't get you all the content and it totally should. Still an awesome driving game\", 'Now I’m not new to the Forza Horizon franchise so it probably prevents me from having an entirely unbiased view. Pros: Beautiful setting, containing different environments for you to drive around and take in the views. Lots of different types of races and events to do in single player mode. Being in-charge of the festivals is pretty cool and gives you something to work towards. Vast amount of cars to choose from. Car dynamics are good and the balance of IA cars hitting you (in-race) has improved since Forza 6. Forzathon weekly events Forzahorizon Edition cars (they have boosts) Cons: Map feels too cluttered as you’re constantly unlocking events to do and you can’t keep up. Cap for amount of players in one world is still too small. Very fiddly to change car and upgrade in comparison to older FH games. Too many drivatars change lane and wipe you out when driving in the open world. Lots of different events but they all taken place on a small amount of actual circuits. Wrist bands seem like a second thought. Now I’ve played the game for quite a few hours and I’ve got to say, I’m really enjoying it. There’s parts of the game that are better than FH2 and parts that aren’t. As usual, they have nailed the driving, which is really the bread and butter of the game. If you haven’t played FH2 then pick that up first as it’s a great game and a good introduction to the franchise, especially if you are mainly into single player.', 'El mejor juego arcade de coches de la historia, asi de simple.

Forza Horizon es precioso, increible, divertido y el mejor juego de conducción y deportes de este **** juego redondo\", 'Horizon 3 looks good, sounds ok, car roster is big for a horizon game and car models look great but the game is littered with small problems that make it very hard to like. AI is horribly unbalanced. I can usually win races on hardest difficulty with no problem. Only exception are cross country events. Some times I have to turn down difficulty to easiest and I still can\\'t win. Pr stunts won\\'t always activate so you have to go back and try again. Doesn\\'t seem like a big issue but do this 30 times in a row and you start losing hair. Other drivers or \"drivatars\" are always on your way when you try to set a record on a speedtrap or other PR stunt. Handling is set between realism and arcade even with all the assists turned off. This is the recipe for a horrible racing game. It\\'s like trying to mix water and oil, the end result is **** Weather effects are cool. Only problem is that its constantly raining. Usually when you try to set a record on pr stunt and you really need the road to be dry. Only solution is to fast travel to festival site and then drive back. This is the only way of passing the time and getting rid of the rain. Some speed zone challenges are so hard its not even funny anymore. Driving a 750kg car with over 700kw V8 under the hood and you still can\\'t make it... talking about ridiculous. Music is again like in all the horizon games complete and utter **** Any dlc that costs money, except big expansions is an automatic -5 from me. Reason to this is insanely high price of games in my country. First horizon game is still the best one.', 'I actually bought an xbox 1 just for this game, something to hold me over until Forza 7, just couldn\\'t play this game for more than about 5 hours because it gets boring VERY quick, I\\'ve bought the last 3 forza\\'s previous to this one. Where this game falls short.. as many others have stated, it\\'s too \"sim\" to be a really fun arcade style race game, too realistic for that, but at the same time, driving all these cars through the desert, running over trees with little penalty completely ruins how real everything looks, I suppose it\\'s a catch 22, more realistic is better looking, but the game itself is arcade-ish themed, guess I\\'ll just wait until Forza 7.', \"One word - AMAZING! Amazing visuals, amazing sound, amazing car park, amazing open-world, amazing online, amazing physics, amazing music! Pure awesomness! If you didn't bought it yet - then do it right now! Without a doubt - 10/10\", 'No se como puede tener tanta nota este juego, a i me parece del monton. No es que tenga muchos juegos de xbox pero la tengo cogiendo polvo. Me gustan otra clase de juegos', \"Oh dear, the opening race against the helicopter, plunging through the rivers and going through the forest you think this is gonna be great. Unfortunately like other open world games you end up just ticking of check points on a map, most of which are ridiculous burn challenges etc where you just do doughnuts. Every time you do anything your confronted by long loading screens where you just stare at your wheel trim. Barn finds are stupid they just appear periodically on the map and you just drive straight there and collect them. Multiplayer is very unbalanced and people with the best cars just fly off with no way to catch them and multistage championships have stupid tag events where you chase each other. I was hoping for fast instant multiplayer championships but this was frustrating. If you just wanna race don't touch it.\", 'Horizon is excellent but you guys already knew that, the first 2 were great but this is by far the best in my opinion.

If it was more realistic, on PC (steam or gog, windows store is not PC) and had less dlc it would be one of the best games ever.

Putting it briefly, the music selection is excellent, and better with the ability to incorporate Groove playlists for your own music, career races can be played as they are, or customised to your preference, and the amount of cars is astounding for an open-world racer, at around 370 at the time of writing. Not to mention, the open world of Australia is very beautiful and varied, and the game is an absolute joy to look at. Conclusion, buy it, whenever you can! Even at full price, it's a steal, the wealth of content that's in it!\", 'Excelente juego, es más, es el mejor juego exclusivo de xbox one, y posiblemente top 10 juegos de la actual generación, contando los juegos de todas las consolas existentes. Para los amantes de los coches y de la velocidad es compra obligada, simplemente alucinante el nivel de detalle de los coches, parecen reales, sonido del motor, interior, exterior, todo... El único punto negativo es totalmente subjetivo, y es básicamente que esta basado en paisajes Australianos, con lo que ello conlleva, es decir... conducen al revés que por ejemplo en España, lo cual crea bastante confusión hasta que llevas muchas horas jugadas y ya conduces con el chip cambiado. Le doy un 10, obra maestra.', 'Forza Horizon 3 is outstanding and a breathe of fresh air, there are lots of activities to complete and the horizon festivals add a niche element to the racing genre. There are a wide variety of cars, bucket lists and championships that you can choose from. These let you race in your own path whenever you feel like. There are multiple online modes that only add to the replay-ability and you can have fun racing with friends while enjoying them. Also, a healthy selection of music in radio stations make you feel good inside. The only negative are the frame drops in certain areas of the game but these are only minor.', \"Awful driving mechanics, I feel disconnected from the road, the vehicles swish in wide uncontrollable slides, it's neither a simulation or a arcade experience - it feels sloppy. Off roading, which is unavoidable, is worst affected, even in off road vehicles there's very little control, in a road car the experience becomes even more painful. There's very little difference to Horizon 2 other than a improvement in graphics, the sound track is poor and cheap, having to unlock radio stations is a bad excuse for a 'addition'. The narration and story is childish and unrefined, where's the effort? The map is small in my opinion, this is fine if the world is perfectly detailed but it's not, people say it's beautiful but in truth it's nothing special or groundbreaking, the 'beauty spots' and the accompanied narration is just useless filler. They're riding the success of the prequel on this one, don't waste your money until it becomes a bargain bucket buy. The driving mechanics are inexcusable. The only good point is that the cars look and sound great.\", 'Welcome to Australia, Forza! The third game in the Horizon spinoff series, the Horizon Festival has moved Down Under. Unlike the first two Horizon games, you are the boss of Horizon, which means you must earn fans to upgrade festivals and unlock showcases. The soundtrack is amazing, all 350 cars - and DLC - sound, look and feel incredible, online multiplayer is brilliant, there are a lot of things to do online and offline and the views are beautiful. All Forza games are great - except Forza 5, due to most of it being DLC - but Horizon 3 is the best one yet!', 'Just great... best Racing Game i ever played !!!!!!!! And i played all Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, Need for Speed,, Burnout, Ridge Racer, Rage Racer, Drive Club, Projekt Gotham Racing and and and...', 'This is the first Forza horizon game which I have played as I don’t tend to play driving games and I have been extremely impressed. There is a massive range of car types and driving environments which prevents the game from getting repetitive. The visuals and audio on the cars are very realistic and the scenery is breath-taking. This could be some of the bet graphics which I have seen on the Xbox one so far. I was impressed with the music choices, however I felt that there could be more tracks on each of the radio stations. There are a lot of hours involved in completing the game and the music starts to become repetitive. The gameplay is excellent as it has a range of fun stunts and challenges along with some competitive racing for some more serious moments. What I enjoy most about the game is seeing cars in unexpected situations stunt and challenge situation or having a race between some of the less obvious cars. I haven’t taken advantage of all of the online feature but I did enjoy rivals mode competing against my friends-list lap times. Although there is no riveting story line I did feel entertained for many hours which would indicate the successful of the game.', 'This video game is very dynamic and extremely entertaining for gamers and any casual car game fanatics it is a pleasure to play this video game. I am glad to see that the people who made the Forza series are stepping up their game with this amazing and beautiful edition of Forza Horizon. I am also impressed with the amazing realism of the physics that are shaping the video game and I am even more hopeful for the future of the Forza Horizon franchise.', 'Best game on Xbox One right now, looks fantastic on my One S and PC. Only disappointment is some of the track designs feel like filler, otherwise definitely worth picking up.', \"let me start by saying Forza horizon 3 is an incredible game, no game is perfect however and there's some major flaws regarding this game that i hope are fixed/updated. the biggest flaw I've come across so far is the sounds. forza is known for the amazing car sounds, sadly this game is not representing that thus far. let me give you some examples. the Hurican in forza horizon 2 sounded amazing, but in this game the hurican is an exact copy and paste sound of both audi r8's in the game. no difference in exhaust note or backfire at all! (im aware the r8 and hurican share engines but going off fh2 they could have made them miles better) also more annoyingly the amg gts, sls , c63 coupe and the alfa 8c ALL SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME. if you care a lot about sounds you will soon find this to be very disappointing and could have been easily avoided if more thought went into sound design. I'm sure i will find more copy and paste sounds as i progress. another problem that I've been noticing (may only be an issue with me) is that when I enter a horizon festival sometimes the game completely freezes and i am forced to restart my consol. over all fh3 totally blows all other racing games out of the water with the insane amount of things to do, map size, graphics, multi-player, and car list. hopefully this game you some insight before you buy, i would recommend you buying it if you enjoyed previous titles.\", 'The probably better arcade driving franchise is back with a whole new features. You are now the host of the Horizon festival, allowing you to make new races and challenges. Its basically Forza Horizon 2, but better.', 'melhor jogo de corrida da geração e um dos melhores do ano, é aquele jogo que merece ser jogado por mais de 100 horas, pois é um jogo que tem muita variedade.', \"FH3 is what you would expect from a Forza game. Great sound, good variety in cars, good modding/tuning(can we please get some decent body kits in the game?), decent sized map and Windows 10 access. I think the intro takes away from the game, it honestly felt like TDU2 all over again, but you get past it. The game kind of feels a little empty after the 1st expansion, and you kind of get to free lance, which is nice in my opinion if you like to just roam. I feel like the 'hire' system could have been left out, in the time I've played I haven't found myself using it much. All things considered, its a fun 'cruise' game to race in, it doesn't topple the substance of a NFS Underground 2, but it is a solid open world racing game. A game you can dump hours into and still feel like there is more to do. I love forza games and hope they never stop making them!\", 'Do you like cars? Do you like Australia? Do you like taking long walks on a beach during a sunset? Do you like taking fast drives on the beach in a photo realistic Lamborghini during the most beautiful digital sunset you have ever seen? Then play this game! Not only does this game look stunning, it is perhaps the best racing game in the past 15 years, heck maybe ever. After unlocking dozens of amazing cars last year in Forza Motorsports 6, I spent weeks racing in the simulation while constantly being amazed at the realism and attention to detail the team at turn 10 were able to bring to the racing genre. I thought this is racing heaven. This June I was watching Xbox\\'s E3 press conference when all of a sudden a kangaroo jumped across the screen in the most amazing photo realistic world. I thought to myself \"Wait, what game is this?\" and just as my mind started to race, a beautiful car drifted onto the screen and all of my fond, distant memories of FH2 and recent memories of FM6 rushed through my head. I could not have been more excited and have had higher expectations for this game. Yet on launch day this game still amazed me. What playground games and turn 10 have done with this game has set the bar at an all time high for racing games. Whether I am drifting down the beach listening to my own playlist of music or jumping sand dunes in Halo\\'s WartHog while ride of the Valkyries blasts through my speakers, the game is always providing fun yet heart pounding action. Online races, customizable challenges, drivatars, and of course Forza Horizon\\'s signature races with boats, trains, and helicopters carrying jeeps all bring something unique to the game. The map is large and diverse, filled with secrets and detail. I could go into more specifics about how great the driving feels or the graphic fidelity of this game on xbox one, not to mention its included xbox anywhere 4k counterpart on the PC, but anyone who has the slightest interest in racing games just needs to experience this game for themselves. Go buy this game! 10/10 Anyone who has rated this game lower than an 8 just does not have interest in racing games. If you don\\'t believe me then go download the free demo. It is a drop in the bucket compared to the full game but you will get a sense of what this game has to offer.', 'simplemente si te gustan los coches, tienes que tener este juego. Es muy divertido cuando no se ve como un simulador, es un excelente arcade de carreras.', 'This is a very slick, fast moving and very beautiful game. And I get to race in a Warthog!!!!! Yeah baby. Big Halo fan here! But I am now also a big fan of Forza. Forza 3 makes you really feel like you are racing in the jungles, beaches and cities of Australia! And the most important thing about this game, is that it is fun!!!!!', 'Melhor game de corrida da atualidade. Jogabilidade e gráficos incríveis. Forza Horizon sempre foi bom mais esse superou todos!

The wealth of things to do, and entertainment far exceeds the price. I do not hesitate in recommending this game', \"So I pre-ordered this game because the trailer made it look amazing. Keep in mind I play console games in single-player mode only. And I did get impressed by the intro. The game felt a bit like being a part of Fast and the Furious but that went away really fast after the first race. The driving experience is full of action but control wise it feels a bit sluggish , the normal Xbox one feels like its having a hard time with the graphics on occasion dropping the down to what feels like 20 fps at times and that makes it hard to control a fast car through tight corners. If you compare the driving experience with Forza 5 or 6 then this is no where near the same good driving experience that Forza 5 or 6 can give you. The scenery can be very beautiful so that's a nice thing. And in the beginning everything seems sort of clear, I quickly figured out what I could do. I kept on making progress up to a point where everything just seemed to be about the same thing over and over and over and over again. (It got really boring after 3-4 hours of game play, I have played this game for a total of 6 hours now) Considering the above then the price for this game is just silly. So I can not give this game a good review. Luckily we have stores that accept games as trade in value for other games so that is what I intend to do now.\", 'jogo bem feito, gráficos lindos, historia contagiante, mundo aberto, diversos tipos de carros , clima dinâmico, varias competições , modo online surpreendente. jogo nota 10', \"If I were asked to describe Forza Horizon 3 in a nutshell, I think I'd pretty much say that it's like a much-lamented Top Gear challenge, in Australia, with your friends and random drivers culled from the population of gamers playing the game across the world. I'd also add that it's a lot of fun, and I really mean FUN with a capital F.U.N. There's something gloriously madcap about being able to hit the open world of Australia with over 450 cars to drive, push them to the limit in a mix of brilliantly designed events. There's something beautiful about hitting a dune in the Outback at 200MPH in a Bugatti Veyron and landing a sweet jump that gives you 3 stars. Forget Football as the 'Beautiful' game, that honour goes to Forza Horizon 3. The bottom line here is that Forza Horizon 3 is a game you really need to play if you have an Xbox One. If you're even the slightest bit interested in this kind of racer, get it, it won't leave you wanting. It might leave you wanting more.\", 'Jogo Excelente,nao tem o que falar jogabilidade muito bom os graficos Lindos Na atualidade nao existe um jogo melhor que Forza,entao essa sera minha nota pela essa obra prima', \"I've spent 30+ hours playing this game and I'm having a blast.

You can have as much multiplayer as you want, you can play coop with your friends who have PCs, you're discovering totally new things every 2 hours again and again and again. It's the 9th forza, and I don't know where it can go from here. This game is an instant classic.\", \"After months of waiting I am excited to be playing a well designed and beautiful Forza Horizon 3. This new branch of probably many more to come forza games is exciting. It looks fantastic and you can't ask for a better control system. You must be wondering why I gave it a mediocre 7? After hours of play time, and enjoying the beautiful scenery I grew bored very quickly. This game seems to be missing a spark that should drive me to complete it (no pun intended). Even though there are additional features, and many cars, it still seems to be very repetitive. This is a new game so I understand it may have some flaws from the start but I do need to say that I have not been able to connect to an online server since my purchase of this game. On an additional note I realized that this game which was created by Playground Game seems to have a lot of ideas taken from Test Drive Unlimited 2 which was created by Eden Games. I am not sure if this was due to lack of creativity, or maybe some type of joint cooperation to make Forza Horizon a great game.\", \"This game is absolutely phenomenal. Best racing experience of this generation WITHOUT exception. I can't wait to dive back in.

In this edition of the Horizon series, you are the boss of the Horizon festival located out in Australia. You also have the power to recreate events into dream events with the new blueprint mode. The blueprint mode allows you change the settings of the current race you're about to join. You simply adjust the weather, time of day, what cars are to be allowed in, the amount of laps to race around in, renaming the race, etc. Bucket lists can also be created instead of changed. You simply choose a car you own, the choose one of the different modes, and then you choose the location. Simple as that. The car list has also been expanded since Horizon 2. Now supporting over 350 cars but however the real star of the show being wide bodykits and much more visual customization. You can even put a Liberty Walk kit on a Ferrari. I don't even know how Forza did it but they did. The handling model has improved quite a bit.

If you love Youtubers, drones and going sideways round corners then this game is perfect for you. If you love being forced to play online, then again, you're gonna love it. If you want a game with loads of varied single player content, then it's going to get boring very quickly. Compared to FH2 it offers nothing new. Yes it has a bigger map but with not variety. It's a laugh and a break for the simulation based racers and online with friends it's a lot of fun, but not everybody likes to drift online. Great exclusive for Xbox One owners, and something than PS4 owners don't have at the moment.\", \"Je qualifierais simplement ce jeu de chef d'oeuvre. Le meilleur jeu de voiture de cette génération. Ne passez pas à coté. il est parfait. (plateforme : XboxOne)\", \"You've all likely heard a range of different positives, so here is my take. I'd personally probably edge more towards 8.5 than 8 but as we're only allowed whole numbers I'll stick with an 8... So, whilst I’ve not quite put in the hours compared to Forza 2 (though I never finished that to be fair, so much content!) I think the new one is better which means it’s my favourite real car racer of all time… It’s not perfect though, here’s what I’d like to see: Festival upgrades – have a management system in place, not just “press X to upgrade” I’d have loved to have maybe a skill tree style thing at each festival with stuff like “resurface roads”, “add more tents to attract fans”, “more garages to attract drivers” etc… that way as you level up you can also spend cash/skill points to improve things how you choose – I’d like to see this in a future entry for sure, but at the moment it's still satisfying. 4-player bucket lists – shame these are only 2 player, or at least the ones we have found are… I’d love to see some 4 player stuff, I know you could find yourself on top of each other, but that’s part of working together! Most other races and showcase events can be tackled with 4 players, so it's a shame. Custom races – love that you can create your own exhibitions and bucket lists, but these are within the limits of the already established tracks/rules – I’d love to actually plot out a route on the map and create a race from scratch, imagine how awesome it would be to do a full lap of the outside roads on the map or to do some crazy drag race style stuff in ridiculously heavy traffic! Photo mode in co-op – this is sorely missing, and the drone has no photography options which is a shame – I’d love to see this as an option so we could take some cool shots – I don’t expect it to pause the game, but to allow us to pose and take some cool, stylised shots, would be neat! Drone – This is cool and very quick at finding barns and other secrets, however it’s also very flawed – I’d like to get a LITTLE bit higher (not talking take off in to space, but just twice the height you can currently achieve) this would be good to better view the area, also it has no lights or anything which is a shame at night, it’s basically useless! Time of Day/weather - When creating a blueprint event you can pick time of day and weather, it would be great to be able to just pause the game and do this too, even if the game then gently rolls you into that setup so it's not jarring... It's mainly for the photo mode that I'd love to see this, I have a lot of random shots of cars parked in the sun, but very few in the extreme weather and I think that's mainly because of me hanging around in the outback. VW - Where is VW?! Missing from the game, and as a big Beetle fan I really wanted to upgrade one to the max and fly around the outback. Other than that I’m in awe at the game, there’s a huge amount of variety in place, with everything you see in Forza Horizon 2 and more including stunt jumps, convoys, co-op campaign, the blueprint system, Groove music integration...\", 'I absolutely love this game, after playing forza Motorsport 5 and forza Horizon 2, this is my favourite by far. The scale of the map is amazing and there is a huge amount of cars available for purchase. I also liked the addition of Aussie classics like the ford falcon etc.', 'Can not deny this game is a upgrade from fh2 not just because of the car list the sound of the cars and the setting but the offroad racing is greatly improved and mobbing around the dunes in a buggy is just a joy this game also looks amazing, it is the best driving game I ever played so far', \"It's everything i want in a car game. One minor issue; glitchy multi-player and general issues with online integrity, most of witch can easily be hot fixed with a patch.\", 'Jogo majestoso, cenários fantásticos, gameplay deslumbrante, grande variedade de veículos e tipos de corridas além da incrível sensação de liberdade ao dirigir pela Austrália.', \"It's an amazing race game that everyone should enjoy. A lot of cars to choose, big map, when you play it makes you believe you in the game, it's nothing but awesome, Playground, Turn 10 and Microsoft Studios are showing why they deserve the trophy **** team.\", \"Honestly one of the most visually beautiful games I've ever played. Hundreds of cars ranging from your first family car to high performance hypercars, and a photo mode to view them all in. I'm not personally the biggest fan of the music and car festival concept the Horizon Festival is, but after you've been playing for a few hours it fades away and you're given the ability to drive around and do all the races you want.\", 'Forza Horizon 3..Best xbox one game for 2016, this game is perfect. 350 vehicles, australia is beautiful, the **** thx microsoft game studios !', 'Exactly what you would expect from the third installation in Forza Horizon series. The same arcade game-play as before, with minor improvements. New and bigger world. More cars. What more could a Forza Horizon fan want :)', 'O melhor jogo de corrida Arcade da geração disparado. A Playground e a Turn10 fizeram um ótimo trabalho. Gráficos bonitos, mapa dinâmico e vivo e a trilha sonora está fantástica assim como no 2. Parabéns.', \"There is a reason these titles continue to be successful, they're just beautifully built games, amazing concept of what people want to do with cars! I enjoy FH series because, it doesn't take racing too seriously, unlike FM that is your serious track game, these games let you enjoy going off road, jumping a car you'd never really get airborne and doing it with your mates! Australia, (STRAYA) which is my home, they have done an amazing version of our coast (Not overly distant accurate) and truly loved driving familiar looking roads! The reason I haven't given this a 10, FROM AN AUSTRALIAN, GET MORE AUSTRALIAN CARS. like the couple in there are nice, but seriously, we arguably have created some of the most powerful muscle cars. VL TURBO, VZ CALAIS 6 LITER, VX, VY, VZ SS, XR6 TURBO, G6E TURBO! COMMON! Make it happen forza!\", \"****. I didn't enjoy an aracade racing game that mich since NFS Most Wanted (2005). Graphics are gorgeous, the landscapes beatiful and the cars very well modellized. Nothing wrong with the gameplay, you'll get the hang of it immediately. As for the content don't worry, you'll sink hundreds of hours in it. Recommended.\", \"This game is phenomenal from the cars the music the races everything is done right. High octane racing Beautiful scenery , you truly are front and center since you're the boss. this is the best racing game this gen. It looks Spectacular in 4K if you have a 4k tv. Gameplay is buttery smooth. If you never played a forza game this is a great game to start with .\", 'jogo muito épico, conseguiu melhorar todos os aspectos do forza horizon 2 que já era um jogo soberbo, e forza horizon 3 é um jogo para marcar a geração, entao deixo minha frase final: ´` parem de chorar sonystas, está feio!', \"The new standard for open world racing games. If you liked the previous Horizons you will be very impressed with this one. It has that Midnight club and Need for speed vibe but is still uniquely it's own. If are more of a sim racer this game is not for you go back to Motorsport and stop complaining about how unrealisticly fun this game is.\", 'This game is just super fun, never been a racing games guy, but this one is just amazing. Lots of content, free roam, beautiful graphics, gorgeous immersive map and it plays amazingly on the PC (thought its demanding). Can also play the game on my XBOX ONE without having to buy the game again. Microsoft, you did extremely well this time.', \"This is not just a racing game , its the best one. As a PS4 owner I just couldn't resist and buy myself an Xbox last month and it's games like this that make it worth the purchase!\", 'best racing game. playground always innovating and bringing a lot of hours of fun. great graphics, great audio, good music. and varieties of **** is 4k upscale on xbox one s', 'Astonishing racing game. Best open world racing game and best racing game overall this generation for me. Huge array of cars and a vast amount of activities and landscapes to roam in a completely open world. 10/10 from me!', 'The third one is always the best of a series, and this game can confirm it, best car games I have played in a while. If you are a race gamer, this is MUST have.', 'It could use a neutral gear when in manual sequential and when ABS is off for some reason I can break during corners without locking up but otherwise, perfect.', 'Melhor jogo de corrida que joguei em minha vida ! superando ate o saudoso NFS Underground 2, Microsoft e a Playground games esta de parabéns ! Gráficos de ultima geração, jogabilidade perfeita, ambientação magnifica !', \"The best arcade race game, you can also play as simulator, it is not a simulator like Motor Sport but you still can change this in game. It's the game of the year no doubt.\", \"FH3 takes what wasn't done well in FH2 (4 race championships that became repetitive; offroading in hypercars being too easy; race checkpoints encouraging corner cutting or weird lines to be fast; RWD cars being too loose; roads that are not exciting to drive on; a map that felt smaller than it should) and replaces all of them with new systems that completely eradicates those gripes, unlocking the true potential of how this type of racer can be such a joy to play. Races feel much better now, with the roads/checkpoints incentivising proper racing lines and hitting the apex. Offroading is much more suited to proper offroaders, while supercars are prone to skip and flip over the bumpy ground. RWD cars are now much more satisfying to drive. The map is once again littered with many icons, and not just four. The game feels a lot more free and open as a result, you have the power to choose what and where your next activity will be. The map now has well designed roads that feel fun to drive on, plenty of bends and elevation changes to put any car through its paces. The lighting model might look bland on occasion, but more often than not it blows away what FH2 had to offer, especially during sunrise/sunsets. The progression system is addicting. Instead of ticking off the next 4 rave championship for the 30th time with 138 to go, completing activities add fans to your festival which unlocks more activities and the big milestone showcases (basically a REP system). Most importantly, Forza Horizon 3 is genuinely really fun to play - all you ever need in a game.\", 'praying ocelot you glanced at the game didnt you? you quite obviously havent played it or watched it more than 5 minutes otherwise you wouldnt be comparing it to gran turismo. you dont even know what an horizon game **** 100% free roaming....sony have NOTHING like this you can go ANYWHERE in the world....through a house **** industrial estate.....a crocodile edge of a river....a jungle.....there are no invisible barriers. its not a sim its all about the horizon **** can it possibly be rehashed whenit has original ideas no other developer has ever done? the open world is gorgeous, you can win an online game by coming last.....which i love.....idiots that just try to ram you....just set your difficulty up high,,,and stay at the back......drive well and make sure you finish.... you get tons of bonus points. this game is about fun through and **** glorious. its the driving game of the generation fanboys giving it a zero are just idiotic jealous morons', 'BY FAR and away the BEST racing sim ever made. Blows away anything the \"competition\" can offer. Drive Club, gran turismo just dont even come close, not even in the same ballpark. Simply packed with content and features. Improves on Horizon 2 in every way. Not sure how they can top this one. Easy 10!', \"The best arcade race game, you can also play as simulator, it is not a simulator like Motor Sport but you still can change this in game. It's the game of the year no doubt.\", \"It's beautiful and many things to do, but i can't help it, I find it boring and extremely unrealistic... driving with a lamborghini in rivers, smashing trees and so on reminded me of the scene in the latest jurassic Park where they we're driving full speed in forests like the amazon.... It's probably not my kind of tea... It reminds me to much of the crappy NFS games Or Dirt games expect the latest Rally dirt that is exceptional. And then comes the online part.... I saw 0 drivers that we're there to drive and avoid you it is just unfun stock car racing by frustrated kids....\", \"It's an amazing race, everyone should play it. A lot of cars to choose, big map, when you play it makes you believe you in the game, it's nothing but awesome, Microsoft Studios is showing why they deserve the trophy of best game producer.\", 'You are the chief this time, and all attentions are over you now. This game is extremely beautifull and all aspects is nothing more superb. Thanks for this marvelous game PlayGround, Turn10 and MS.', 'An almost impossibly beautiful landscape actually outshines the gorgeous roster of automobiles in this romping, multifaceted funfest. The multitude of objectives make this a great game for almost any gamer demographic and the flexibility of gameplay ensures that everyone will have a good time doing it. Months of frivolous fun await those that pick this game up....Game of the Year candidate without a doubt.', 'Simeplemente es el mejor juego de carreras al que podrías jugar. Es un todo en 1 en conducción. Llevo desde niño jugando a juegos de carreras y en mi vida he visto algo como esto. 10.', 'Big , Beautiful, Sounds great and gets the blood pumping. a brilliant racing game that improves on the previous outing. Australia is the perfect setting and is authentically recreated. This year its up to you to manage the Horizon festival and so far its one hell of a ride.', \"I'm really loving the game nothing to explain here just buy it! I completely recommend it! Really surprised me that it has no downgrades with classic features like auction back in the game the game if off to a big start and they will build off more in the future which is great all games should be flooded like this and more imo!\", \"Forza Horizon returns! This time the Festival visits Australia which was a good choice for scenic purposes. Now, I am not a car guy, I literally know nothing about cars. But I bought Horizon 2 on Black Friday two years ago and I loved it. So I had high expectations for Horizon 3. It delivers on those expectations. The game immediately tosses you in as the Festival leader for the first time, walking you through new features like hiring drivatars to work for the Festival, hiring radio stations, or building a fan base through both races and stunt events. Showcase events are back and the game pretty much kicks off with the showcase that is shown in many of the trailers, where you race a huge double-rotor helicopter. I bought the Early Access because I am out of town next week and I really wanted to play ASAP, and I'm glad I did. It's been fun. Horizon 3 is an easy game to pick up, but you can make it as challenging as you would like. There's a lot of flexibility and customization, but at the same time it's not overwhelming. Many features and vehicles from previous Forza games return. The graphics look great, especially the Australian environment and sky. There are a ton of songs to listen to as you play, from EDM to classical, or just drive in silence. I highly recommend buying this game if you are a car person or a driving simulator enthusiast. The game has a 91 on Metacritic, so they must have done something right with this game. I have loved it and look forward to playing it in the weeks ahead.\"]\n"
